# QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION


## 1) What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation? 
A: The "Four Freedoms" ensure that the users have full control over the software they use.
They are:
1. **Freedom 0**: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
2. **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works and modify it to suit your
                  needs. (Access to the source code is a prerequisite.)
4. **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies to help others.
5. **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so the whole
                  community can benefit. (Again, access to the source code is required.)

## 2) How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?
The GNU Manifesto justifies the ethical importance of free software by emphasizing user freedom, 
cooperation, and social responsibility. Richard Stallman argues that:
1. **Software should promote freedom, not restrict it**: Proprietary software takes control away
                                                         from users, preventing them from studying,
                                                         modifying, or sharing it. Free software ensures
                                                         users have autonomy over their computing.
2. **Sharing is morally right**: Stallman equates software sharing with acts of kindness, similar to sharing
                                 knowledge or scientific discoveries. He opposes proprietary software because
                                 it forces artificial scarcity and restricts collaboration.
3. **A community-driven approach benefits everyone**: By making software free, developers and users can work
                                                      together to improve it, leading to better software and
                                                      greater technological advancement.
4. **Proprietary software creates social division**: It prevents cooperation by legally restricting users from
                                                     helping one another. Free software fosters a culture of mutual
                                                     support and collaboration.
5. **Users should have control over the tools they use**: If a program is proprietary, users must trust the company
                                                          that owns it. Free software allows users to inspect and modify
                                                          code, ensuring transparency and security.

By framing software freedom as a matter of ethics and justice, the GNU Manifesto presents free software as a movement for 
social good, not just a technical preference.

## 3) What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?

| Feature           | Free Software                        | Open Source Software                |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Philosophy**   | Ethical movement focused on user freedom | Practical approach focused on better development |
| **Main Goal**   | Ensuring user control and rights | Improving software quality and collaboration |
| **Licensing**   | Requires software to remain free (copyleft) | Allows permissive licenses, including proprietary use |
| **Key Advocate** | Free Software Foundation (FSF), Richard Stallman | Open Source Initiative (OSI), Eric Raymond, Linus Torvalds |
| **Restrictions** | Proprietary modifications are **not allowed** | Can allow proprietary modifications |
| **Example License** | GNU General Public License (GPL) | MIT, Apache, BSD |
